Fuzzy matching: Implement fuzzy matching algorithms to find the closest matching area and city names based on the input. Techniques like Levenshtein distance or the Jaro-Winkler distance can help identify the most similar valid area and city names even if there are minor spelling mistakes. You can utilize libraries like fuzzyset.js or fuse.js for fuzzy matching in JavaScript.
